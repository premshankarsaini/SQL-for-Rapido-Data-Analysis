# SQL for Rapido Ride Data Analysis
This SQL project focuses on analyzing Rapido’s ride performance, distance metrics, and cancellation trends using SQL queries and views. It helps uncover insights into operational efficiency and customer behavior through structured database queries.

## Introduction:
The Rapido Ride SQL Project is designed to extract valuable insights from ride-sharing data using SQL queries.
Key objectives:

* Analyze ride completion and cancellation rates.
* Measure average distances per service type.
* Track cancelled rides for operational improvement.
* Provide ratio analysis of completed vs cancelled rides.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes:
* **Ride Status** – Completed or Cancelled.
* **Service Type** – Bike, Auto, Cab, etc.
* **Distance** – Total ride distance.
* **Ride Charges** – Fare per ride.
* **Payment Method** – Paytm, GPay, Amazon Pay, QR scan, etc.
* **Date** – Ride date and time.

## Insights from SQL Analysis:
**Successful rides:** Helps track operational efficiency.           
**Average distance:** Identifies typical ride lengths per service type.                       
**Cancellation count:** Pinpoints the extent of ride drop-offs.                           
**Completion-to-cancellation ratio:** Evaluates service reliability.                   

## How to Run the SQL Project:
* Import Rapido_Project(SQL).sql into your SQL environment (MySQL Workbench, SQL Server, etc.).
* Run each query to create the views.
* Use SELECT * FROM view_name; to explore the data from each view.
